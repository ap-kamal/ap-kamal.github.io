##### [Credit Card Customer Segmentation](/1.1_Credit_card.md)
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Nowadays, credit cards are the most used tool to pay for services and foods and also to borrow money, and make big purchases using EMI (Equated Monthly Installment), and are also useful in emergency situations.The Motivation behind performing the credit card customer segmentation is that the financial institutions can optimize the marketing strategy based on customer preferences and can reduce marketing costs and stop unnecessary marketing which doesn’t align with customer interests and due to the user-friendly deals the customers are happy and will remain using the company’s services and also it helps in the company to increase the customer base due to customer-tailored services.
This project includes Data preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis, and then we have performed the clustering using different clustering techniques like K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering along with creating interactive R Shiny dashboard.

##### [Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using ARIMA](/02_Crypto.pdf)
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Cryptocurrency is a new form of asset which is used for paying or investing digitally. The upsurge in the various cryptocurrency prices over the past 10 years has increased the curiosity of researchers and investors to analyze and forecast its prices in the future. The primary focus of this research is to develop an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is a time-series statistical model, for forecasting the cryptocurrency prices. This research focuses on six different cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, DogeCoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, XRP and Cardano due to their popularity, and discusses the price movements and the stability of these cryptocurrencies using various exploratory data analysis techniques and visualization techniques. The dataset for these six coins has been collected from Kaggle datasets and has been merged into a single dataset. In this research, the dataset has a record of the prices of these six cryptocurrencies dated from 2018 to 2021.

##### [H1B Visa Prediction Analysis](/H1B_Visa_Report.pdf)
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
H1-B visas are a type of non-immigrant visa for foreign national professionals who wish to work in the United States. As of FY 2022, there were around 308,613 H-1B registrations from 37,000 prospective petitioners. The visa requires the applicant to have an employment letter which indicates their legal employment in order to file an application to the US immigration service (USCIS). The number of applications approved by USCIS yearly should not exceed 85000 but the non-immigrants who wish to work in United States are outnumbered recently. The selection of the visa process is based on lottery; hence, it is crucial to understand the case status movements from the past years and to analyze which all factors thus affecting the approval of the visa. In this project, we have performed various exploratory data analysis to understand the trends and variation of H1-B visa application certification to help both the employee and the employer.

##### [Airbnb backend database creation](/3_SQL_airbnb.pdf)
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
As the urge of people towards exploring the world keeps on increasing, not only the famous cities but also exotic suburban places are also getting flooded with tourists.

The problem that we are going to address is eliminating the inconsistency in Airbnb dataset by creating and normalizing the database system provides efficiency in storing and accessing the huge amount of data and provides hassle free user interface to the users. Normalization using BCNF and query analysis are performed for the dataset.
